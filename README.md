# BANKING MANAGEMENT AND CREDIT CARD NUMBER GENERATION
For my class 12 CS class final project, I created an internet banking project. The project involves the basic but crucial functionality involved with the bank management system. A user can create an account or login with their existing credentials, access or chnage their account details, view their trasnaction history and withdraw and deposit money. The project also generates a random and unique credit card number for each user, depending on their card type choice, based on the Luhn algorithm. 
The project was created using Python - particularly using file parsing and Tkinter.
